# Introduction

In this project I tried to create a Pong game. 
I wanted to make it in the Turtle module.
I thought it would be a fun thing to create.


## Problems 

Python was easier to learn, then JavaScript.
My biggest problem in this assignment was to make the ball to be able to collide with the paddles in the game.

#### Extra Word

Sadly enough, I did not manage to finish the game. 
With the winter holidays are coming up and trying to work at the same time as I study.
I couldnÂ´t get enough time for work, studies and programming.
I did not want to use Heroku, cause my economy is bad enough as it is.
It may be only 5$, but not everyone can even spend that when everything else takes priority.
I am even at the moment thinking to drop the course, cause of the economic drain that it is.
